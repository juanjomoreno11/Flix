### Notes
I had some issues while building this app. The most expected one was that, since I am a beginner in swift, it took me some time to understand each step. Also, it was case sensitive (as always) and I had some dumb mistakes that were finally fixed by changing one letter or so, especially installing the cocoa pods. Furthermore, when I was typing "pod init" in terminal, it was giving me an error, and I finally realized I had to download the pods before running that command. Nonetheless, it was a fun project :).
