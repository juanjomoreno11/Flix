### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The challenges that I encountered bilding this app were mainly because I was busy with midterm projects for my other classes, so the only day I had free to do it was right on the deadline. So it was a little stressing to do it all on a rush.

### Notes
I had some issues while building this app. The most expected one was that, since I am a beginner in swift, it took me some time to understand each step. Also, it was case sensitive (as always) and I had some dumb mistakes that were finally fixed by changing one letter or so, especially installing the cocoa pods. Furthermore, when I was typing "pod init" in terminal, it was giving me an error, and I finally realized I had to download the pods before running that command. Nonetheless, it was a fun project :).
